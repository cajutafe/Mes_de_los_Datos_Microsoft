    "Measures of central tendency\n",
    "To understand the distribution better, we can examine so-called measures of central tendency, which is a fancy way of describing statistics that represent the \"middle\" of the data. The goal of this analysis is to try to find a \"typical\" value. Common ways to define the middle of the data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean: A simple average based on adding together all of the values in the sample set and then dividing the total by the number of samples.\n",
    "The median: The value in the middle of the range of all of the sample values.\n",
    "The mode: The most commonly occurring value in the sample set*.\n",
    "Let's calculate these values, along with the minimum and maximum values for comparison, and show them on the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Of course, in some sample sets, there may be a tie for the most common value. In those cases, the dataset is described as bimodal or even multimodal."
